# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this excercise was to understand and utilize Jupyter Notebook in order to read a Microsoft Excell file and create a data Frame which conatined a set of data for multiple schools in the same district, as shown in Figure 1. Python was also used to code the Jupyter Notebook cells and create lists, series, and data frames, while also allowing for users to locate and edit data in previous data frames and create new ones, as shown in Figures 2.

* The only school summary that changed was for the Thomas High School, as they were the only school to have students' scores be nullified
* Replacing the ninth graders' scores for Thomas High School gave them the 2nd highest overall percentage passing of all the high schools in the district (As Shown in Figure 5)

* Replacing the ninth graders' scores saw an overall increase in scores and percenatges for Thomas High School
* Replacing the ninth graders' scores saw no difference in the scores by school spending, size, or school type (reference Figure 2)
## Summary
Four changes in the updated school district analysis were:
  1. Thomas High School had a higher overall percentage passing
  2. All of the top 5 Schools in overall percentage passing were charter schools
  3. Out of the top 5 schools for overal percenatge passing, 3 of them had a school budget of over a million dollars
  4. The top 5 schools in overall percentage passing were at or above 90%
